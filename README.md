Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this challenge, we apply our Python and unsupervised learning expertise to predict the impact of 24-hour or 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies, a practical use case that can guide investment decisions.
We used the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file. Created a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the coin_id index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
We employed the elbow method, a crucial technique in unsupervised learning, to determine the optimal value for k, ensuring our clustering is accurate and reliable.

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (CPA) to create a new Data Frame and set the coin_id index from the original Data Frame as the index for the new Data Frame.

Finally, we visually analyze the cluster analysis results by contrasting the outcome of the composing plot.
